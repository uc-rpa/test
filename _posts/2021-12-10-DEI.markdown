The RPA is pleased to host a presentation on how to craft a winning DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) statement featuring Dr. David Lo (Senior Associate Dean for Research and Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Sciences) and Dr. Juliet McMullin (Professor of Anthropology). A strong DEI statement is a critical component of any competitive application, so don't miss this chance to improve (or get started) on yours!

Please join us (virtually) on **Friday, December 10th** by registering *[here](https://ucr.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAqf-2urzIjG9D_qHkscc2iCkFHQPyNrKpa)*.
